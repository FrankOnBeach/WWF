This project aims to cross-check IUCN's threat list with Google Scholar.

## Challenges
After poking around. It seems the problems are
- Not all Scientific Names are formatted well(Some contain non letters)
- There are dashes in the threats (Don't think query likes that)
- Sleep time was not long enough. (This kinda make this impossible. It would potentially require the program to run for 10 days. )
