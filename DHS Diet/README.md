# Machine Learning On DHS Children's Nutrition Data

In this project, we grouped the DHS Children's Nutrition data by cell, and we are interested to see if we are able to predict the precentage of the households that each item is given to children.

Different models are used in this project. To improve the performance, we adopted bagging and boosting strategies to see if they further improve our models' performance. We also evaluate our models using different metrics. 

We need to think about what is more important to us. Do want to recall as much low protein consumption areas as possible? Or do we want all the results recovered to be more accurate?
